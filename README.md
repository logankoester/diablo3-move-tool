Diablo 3 Move Tool
=================

> A small utility to keymap movement actions in [Diablo 3](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d3/). You can use WASD or arrow keys instead of the mouse, or just point the cursor where you want to go and run in that direction automatically.

This tool is probably a violation of game policy and could result in your account being banned. You've been warned!

## Setup

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/logankoester/diablo3-move-tool/releases) and run it, or clone the source and  build it yourself with the free tools from [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/). I recommend dropping the binary into its
own directory, as it will create a couple files of its own.

## Contributions

I won't be actively maintaining this project; my primary interest was in learning the Autohotkey scripting language. Feel free to fork the code. It is MIT licensed.
